### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


<p>Hey, I'm Jackson Uptain, I live in Alabama, I'm 14 years old and for the last 9 months I've been working on code projects. I learned how to code at Codecademy.com and I've enjoyed every minute of it. My current skills are in: JavaScript, Java, HTML5, CSS, and system OS like the Raspberry PI. I also love experimenting with files and A-Frame web VR. If your interested in collaborating with me then just invite me to your Organization. Feel free to check out my friends YouTube channel at: https://m.youtube.com/@JacobDion09 ; Feel free to Subscribe to him...It's just as FREE to subscribe to him as it is to follow me. (My favorite video is the ultra shirt)...I hope you enjoy my website and my friends videos. This is a very active and experimental account, so feel free to check in every once in a while</p>

<p>PS: I decided to edit my readme. My account has steadily been growing in followers, yet not in stars, so please feel free to Star my top quotes website, it's a good read, and it's kinda experimental. HTTPS://jacksonuptain.github.io/topquotes/</p>
