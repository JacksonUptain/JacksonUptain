### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦

<p>Currently: I've taken a small break on GitHub to get more experience...I've now decide that I want to finish what I started almost a year ago. I was introduced to A-Frame Web VR only a couple weeks into coding; so, I decide I would try my hand at it. I failed brutally due to my lack of skill. One year later... I want to start again on my first project ever, but make it as AWESOME as possible and totally available to the public. In conclusion, I hope you enjoy my new series of Star Wars A-Frame Web VR!</p>

<p>Hey, I'm Jackson Uptain, I live in Alabama, I'm 14 years old and for the last 11 months I've been working on code projects. I learned how to code at Codecademy.com and I've enjoyed every minute of it. My current skills are in: JavaScript, Java, HTML5, CSS, and system OS like the Raspberry PI. I also love experimenting with files and A-Frame web VR. If your interested in collaborating with me then just invite me to your Organization. This is a very active and experimental account, so feel free to check in every once in a while</p>

<p>PS: I decided to edit my readme. My account has steadily been growing in followers, yet not in stars, so please feel free to Star my top quotes website.</p>
