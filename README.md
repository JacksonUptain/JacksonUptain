<p><strong>Currently: <br>I've taken a small break on GitHub to dive deeper into 3d game development...I have invited some friends to join me and it's been fun! I went to the basics of rendering 3d in java and OpenGL.. Currently we are working on a game, and according to my friends, were going to put it up for sale. </strong></p>

<p><strong>Hey, I'm Jackson Uptain, I live in Alabama, I'm 14 years old and for the last 11 months I've been working on code projects. I learned how to code at Codecademy.com and I've enjoyed every minute of it. My current skills are in: JavaScript, Java, HTML5, CSS, and system OS like the Raspberry PI. I also love experimenting with A-Frame web VR and Three.JS. If your interested in collaborating with me then just invite me to your Organization. This is a very active and experimental account, so feel free to check in every once in a while</strong></p>
